--The primary aim of this mini-project is to get a conceptual framework for how NFT's - specifically
ERC721 type tokens are bought, sold and displayed to a set of users on a marketplace.

-- This is meant to be a sort of prototypical implementation of a grander project.



##We will have 3 main sections##

i) On Sale - this is used to display to the users all the tokens on sale at that moment. It will contain maybe a picture of the item and a price underneath <br>

ii) BUY/SELL - This section displays tokens that we can trade/ buy/sell
<br>

iii) Your NFT's - This displays all the items owned by a given user

-- We need to be able to check in real-time NFT balances of customers; Also allow sign-in and sign-out with metamask.

-- We also need to check in real time, smart contract enevts
